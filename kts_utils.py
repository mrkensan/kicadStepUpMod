#*   This FreeCAD workbench is derived from the work of the Kicad STEPUP    *
#*   team including Maurice easyw@katamail.com and numerous others.         *
#*                                                                          *
#*   The purpose of this workbench is to provide a single-function tool     *
#*   for converting KiCAD PCBs to useful STEP models for use in non-FreeCAD *
#*   MCAD packages. Our intent is to add a few enhancements to the original *
#*   while keeping the core functionality similar.                          *
#*                                                                          *
#*   Because our use-case does not require manipulation in FreeCAD of the   *
#*   PCB nor round-tipping of MCAD-ECAD data, we have simplified that part  *
#*   of the workbench core-code and UI.                                     *
#*                                                                          *
#*   We hope that this workbench is useful to the community!                *
